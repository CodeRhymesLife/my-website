    <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
    
    <p>
        When I was younger I wanted to be an architect, so Legos and K'Nex were my creative tools.
        When I think about the structures I built then I'm reminded of my love for software.
        There's something special about making a dream a reality, and the things you learn along the way.
        Below are a few things I've worked on over the years and a few things I plan to do in the future.

                I'm researching ways to use medical image processing, virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), 3D modeling and 3D printing to decentralize catheterization procedures.

                <h5>Research Interests:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>VR & MR Procedural Guidance</b>: I'm investigating how VR and MR can improve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_catheterization" target="_blank">catheterization procedures</a> by comparing conventional procedures to those performed in a novel simulator (see medmod-sim under My GitHub above) using medical image processing, VR, MR, sensors and 3D printing (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pss_oNLa64zbB8OdCJjUB1zj7Vb4KNYv" target="_blank">video 1</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lUXK06cWIYIcm8cMJcoedTnnCohcmmdV" target="_blank">video 2</a>).</li>
                    <li><b>VR and MR Surgical Planning and Education</b>: How do VR and MR influence surgical planning and medical education? I'm exploring this question in novel VR and MR 3D model viewers (see medmod-vr and medmod-mr un My GitHub above) with physicians at Seattle Children's, UC Irvine and University of Washington (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1NS6GyttLg" target="_blank">video</a>)</li>
                    <li><b>Self Driving Catheters</b>: I can't wait to explore how realtime ultrasound image processing, AI and robotics can programmatically guide catheters. I hope this research helps improve who has access to safe catheter based treatments, because far too few do.</li>

                <p>
                <p>I worked as a full stack engineer on the following Microsoft Office products:<p>

                <h5>OneNote</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Cloud Services</b>: Collaborating with OneDrive, I developed, tested and maintained RESTful APIs in C# on Azure for OneNote client applications. This introduced me to the power and importance of cloud services.</li>
                    <li><b>Authentication</b>: I developed an OAuth authentication service for OneNote client users. This showed me the importance of security and power of OAuth and similar technologies.</li>
                    <li><b>Website</b>: I developed the first version of <a href="dev.onenote.com" target="_blank">dev.onenote.com</a> using Typescript and ASP.NET</li>
                    <li><b>Testing</b>: I developed unit and end-to-end tests for my features. This taught me how tests speed up development despite having a large upfront cost.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Access</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Team</b>: Access 2010 was the best dev team I've ever worked on. This experience showed me the importance of the people to the product.</li>
                    <li><b>SQL</b>: I developed several features that stored and retrieved information in SQL. This showed me the benefits and drawbacks of a structured DB.</li>
                    <li><b>C++, C#, Javascript</b>: I developed several features using a few languages that cross-communicated. This taught me that languages are like tools on a tool belt that should be used together to build efficiently.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>I received a B.S. in computer science from the University of Michigan in 2010 where I had many great experiences:<p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>CUDA Medical Image Processing</b>: I helped develop a CUDA module that processed brain images on a GPU. This experience showed me the power of GPU processing and its potential to improve healthcare.</li>
                    <li><b>Object Oriented Programming</b>: My toughest class at UMich taught me OOP in C++. We created std classes from scratch and used them to create a command line game. After this class I was sure I picked the right field.</li>
                    <li><b>Computer Architecture</b>: In this class I learned how software interacts with hardware and how to think about writing performant applications.</li>
                    <li><b>Football</b>: This has nothing to do with software, but it's worth mentioning that I will forever bleed maize and blue. Umich has the best student section in the nation in my completely unbiased opinion. Go blue!</li>
