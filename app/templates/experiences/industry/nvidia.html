    <p>
        We developed an <a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo" target="_blank">Argo</a>-based GPU accellerated medical image processing service deployed with Kubernetes.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Machine Learning Pipelines</b>: I worked closely with machine learning developers to debug and deploy their models in our service, gathering important user feedback along the way.</li>
            <li><b>Kubernetes & Helm</b>: I worked with my team to deploy our service using Kubernetes and Helm.</li>
            <li><b>Command Line Interface</b>: I developed a command line interface, analogous to kubectl, to facilitate interactions with the Clara service in Kubernetes.</li>
            <li><b>Logging Service</b>: I developed a logging service consisting of Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana (EFK) to help my team and our users debug and optimize medical image processing pipelines.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
