            <li><b>Team</b>: Access 2010 had an incredible team. This experience showed me the importance of the people to the product.</li>
            <li><b>SQL</b>: I developed several features that stored and retrieved information in SQL. This showed me the benefits and drawbacks of a structured DB.</li>
            <li><b>C++, C#, Javascript</b>: I developed several features using a few languages that cross-communicated. This taught me that languages are like tools on a tool belt that should be used together to build efficiently.</li>
