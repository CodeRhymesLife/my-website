I'm researching ways to use medical image processing, virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), 3D modeling and 3D printing to decentralize catheterization procedures.

<h5>Research Interests:</h5>
<ul>
    <li><b>VR & MR Procedural Guidance</b>: I'm investigating how VR and MR can improve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_catheterization" target="_blank">catheterization procedures</a> by comparing conventional procedures to those performed in a novel simulator (see medmod-sim under My GitHub above) using medical image processing, VR, MR, sensors and 3D printing (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pss_oNLa64zbB8OdCJjUB1zj7Vb4KNYv" target="_blank">video 1</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lUXK06cWIYIcm8cMJcoedTnnCohcmmdV" target="_blank">video 2</a>).</li>
    <li><b>VR and MR Surgical Planning and Education</b>: How do VR and MR influence surgical planning and medical education? I'm exploring this question in novel VR and MR 3D model viewers (see medmod-vr and medmod-mr un My GitHub above) with physicians at Seattle Children's, UC Irvine and University of Washington (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1NS6GyttLg" target="_blank">video</a>)</li>
    <li><b>Self Driving Catheters</b>: I can't wait to explore how realtime ultrasound image processing, AI and robotics can programmatically guide catheters. I hope this research helps improve who has access to safe catheter based treatments, because far too few do.</li>
